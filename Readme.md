API Endpoints
User Registration: POST /signup

Accepts user information including username and password.
Password is hashed before being stored in the database using bcrypt.
User Authentication: POST /signin

Authenticates user credentials and generates a JWT token.
Team Management:

GET /teams: Retrieve a list of teams.
POST /teams/create: Create a new team.
POST /teams/:teamId/addMember: Add a member to a team.
DELETE /teams/:teamId/remove: Remove a member from a team.
Password Management
When a user signs up, the password is securely hashed using the bcrypt library before being stored in the MongoDB database. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, user passwords remain protected.

javascript
Copy code
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

// Example of password hashing during signup
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(user.password, saltRounds);
Frontend
State Management
The frontend uses Redux for state management, which helps manage the application's global state, including user authentication and team information.

Signup and Login Forms: Allow users to register and authenticate.
Team Management: Interface for creating teams and managing members.
